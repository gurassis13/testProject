PROJECT INTRODUCTION
In this project i would be creating a website named as fix-it.in this website i will provide
repair services such as plumbering ,electrician ,mechanic, carpenters,mobile and laptop technicians.
It is often seen that people had to pay much higher for all these skill based jobs as there aren't 
many competitors so our main motive would be to provide all these services at a much cheaper cost so that 
everyone could easily acess all these services asap.moreover, we will also provide jobs and training to new
candidates who would like to join the team and work with the team.
